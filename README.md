# Sunken Cost

## Introduction
This is the game I'm currently working on in Unity. It's a micro deck-building roguelike where the player rearranges planks that form the enemies' traversal path. 
The player drafts new designs for planks at the end of each combat, which are then drawn randomly to form the path for the next combat.
